  <p>Snoop is one of the best friend I have as a pet. She is always with me whenever I'm at home</p>
  <p>She has the best manners in pet's category and following are the best activities we do together:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jogging in the morning</li>
    <li>Play Interactive Games</li>
    <li>Swimming together</li>
  </ul>
  <h1> All I love  about my puppy <strong>Snoop</strong></h1>
    <img src="/images/puppy1.jpg" alt="My Snoop Puppy">
    <ol>
      <li>She likes to use my ankle as a chin rest.</li>
      <li>She is fond of nectarines.</li>
      <li>She smiles. She really does.</li>
      <li>An empty yogurt container can entertain her for the better part of an afternoon.</li>
      <li>She has no problem with sleeping in.</li>
      <li>She responds to several nicknames including Carlie, Noodle, Noosie, Noo-del, Rosemarino, Carleen, Carlata, Shamu and, occasionally, Le Pamplemouse.</li>
      <li>Before I met her, her personality was described to me as ambitious, and this truly fits her.</li>
      <li>She is very busy.</li>
      <li>She is the most curious dog I have ever met.</li>
      <li>If I am at my desk for more than three hours in a row, she will go to the bathroom door (the farthest she can get from my desk and still be in my apartment), take a running start and hurl herself into my chair legs, repeatedly, until I leave my desk.</li>
      <li>She snorts.</li>
      <li>When she wants attention, she does what I call the chomp-chomp. She bites at the air, twice, with an additional burst of growl.</li>
      <li>She loves my dad.</li>
    </ol>
